# In which we play around at making an elm app

Kent wants to make a poker app, and if you're going to make a web app and have FUN with it,
you might as well do it in Elm.

The purpose of this is to ensemble with random people in our Tensegrity Discord server. (you get access if you support me on [Patreon](https://jessitron.com/patreon).)

## Development

Work on [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/systemsthinking-dev/poker-in-elm) -- this should open a dev env
